      "text2": "If something you like is the wrong in size or don’t fit your body, you don't have to take them off, change into your clothes, go out, look for the right size, go back and start the whole process again. No logic science is there just a simple step, and you can return your order.",
      "text3": "Many people don’t trust the idea of adding their credit card information to the shopping website. Online shopping means we will need to pay for our purchases via a credit card, a PayPal account, or Visa card. Not everyone is comfortable paying in this way because of that, most people will continue to shop in stores when they can shop online."
